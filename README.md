# Mean Girl Missing

Remember the 2004 cult movie "Mean Girls"? 

Regina is missing and it's a mystery.
You have to find her location and you only have five minutes.

1. Download the file missing_mystery.sqlite3
2. Open the file on Tableplus and start digging for clues using SQL queries about Regina George 

When you think you know which hotel she is at enter:
    ```sql
    INSERT INTO solution VALUES (1, "Hotel name");

    SELECT value FROM solution;
    ```
